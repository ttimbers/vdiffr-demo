## `vdiffr` demo

<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  out.width = "100%"
)
```

This is a demonstration 
of how to use the [`vdiffr`](https://vdiffr.r-lib.org/index.html) package 
for visual regression testing in R.

Say you have a function 
that creates a nicely formatted scatter plot using `ggplot2`, 
such as the one shown below:

```{r scatter-function, fig.width=4, fig.height=4, out.width="50%", fig.retina=2}

pretty_scatter <- function(.data, x_axis_col, y_axis_col) {
    ggplot2::ggplot(data = .data, 
                    ggplot2::aes(x = {{ x_axis_col }}, y = {{ y_axis_col }})) +
        ggplot2::geom_point(alpha = 0.8, colour = "steelblue", size = 3) +
        ggplot2::theme_bw() +
        ggplot2::theme(text = ggplot2::element_text(size = 14))
}

library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)
penguins_scatter <- pretty_scatter(penguins, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm) + 
    labs(x = "Bill length (mm)", y = "Bill depth (mm)")
penguins_scatter
```

And you want to write tests to make sure that as you further develope 
and refactor your code, you do not break it. 
You can use the `vdiffr` visual regression testing package to do this.
First, you need to abstract the function to an R script that lives in `R`.
For this demo, we created a file called `R/pretty_scatter.R` 
that houses the `pretty_scatter` function shown above.

Then you need to setup a `tests` directory 
and tests file in which to house your tests 
that works with the testthat framework 
(we recommend using `usethis::use_testthat()` 
and `usethis::use_test("FUNCTION_NAME")` to do this).

Finally, add an expectation with `vdiffr::expect_doppelganger` to your 
`test_that` statement:

```r
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)
library(vdiffr)
source("../../R/pretty_scatter.R")

penguins_scatter <- pretty_scatter(penguins, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm) + 
    labs(x = "Bill length (mm)", y = "Bill depth (mm)")
penguins_scatter

test_that("refactoring our code should not change our plot", {
    expect_doppelganger("pretty scatter", penguins_scatter)
})
```

Then when you run `testthat::test_dir("tests/testthat")` 
to run your test suite for the first time, 
it will take a snapshot of the figure created in your test for that visualization 
and save it to `tests/testthat/_snaps/EXPECT_DOPPELGANGER_TITLE.svg`.
Then as you refactor your code, you and run `testthat::test_dir("tests/testthat")` 
it will compare a new snapshot of the figure with the existing one.
If they differ, the tests will fail. 
You can then run `testthat::snapshot_review()` to get an interactive viewer 
which will let you compare the two data visualizations 
and allow you to either choose to accept the new snapshot 
(if you wish to include the changes to the data visualization 
as part of your code revision and refactoring)
or you can stop the app and revert/fix some of your code changes 
so that the data visualization is not unintentionally changed.

Below we show an example of running `testthat::snapshot_review()`
after we made our tests fail by removing `alpha = 0.8` from our `pretty_scatter`
function source:

```{r snapshot-reviewer, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/snapshot-reviewer.png")
```
